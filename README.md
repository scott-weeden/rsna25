## 1. RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection Challenge 2025

### Competition specifications reveal unprecedented scale

The 2025 RSNA challenge represents the **first-ever multi-modal intracranial aneurysm detection competition**, launched July 29, 2025 with submissions closing October 14, 2025. The competition leverages a massive dataset of **over 6,500 imaging studies containing 3,500+ annotated aneurysms** from 18 sites across five continents, making it the most globally diverse neuroimaging challenge to date.

**Multi-modal imaging approach**: The challenge uniquely spans Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA), and conventional MRI sequences (T1 post-contrast and T2-weighted), focusing on "opportunistic screening" using routine brain imaging rather than dedicated aneurysm-specific scans. This approach addresses the critical clinical problem where **50% of intracranial aneurysms are only identified after rupture**, carrying mortality rates up to 50%.

**Technical requirements**: The competition uses DICOM format images with double expert annotations covering 13 distinct anatomical locations within the intracranial circulation. 3D segmentations are provided for MRI studies. Evaluation metrics likely include sensitivity, specificity, false positive rates, Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), and localization accuracy measured by Intersection over Union (IoU). The competition platform is hosted on Kaggle with a **$50,000 prize pool** distributed among the top 9 competitors.

## 2. IRIS Framework: First Public Implementation

### üéØ Historic Achievement: First Public Reproduction of Microsoft Research

This repository represents the **FIRST EVER publicly available implementation** that successfully reproduces the findings of the Microsoft Research team's groundbreaking paper: [Show and Segment: Universal Medical Image Segmentation via In-Context Learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/html/Gao_Show_and_Segment_Universal_Medical_Image_Segmentation_via_In-Context_Learning_CVPR_2025_paper.html) <img width="147" height="31" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee10874e-113f-4b97-8c5b-f94d2242d46f" />

### Key Achievements:

- **First Public Implementation**: No other public repository has successfully reproduced Microsoft's IRIS framework
- **Validated Results**: Achieved 75% DICE score on AMOS22 spleen segmentation matching paper claims
- **Minimal Hardware Requirements**: Successfully trained with only 13MB model size
- **Cross-Domain Application**: Extended from abdominal to brain segmentation

### Implementation by Texas Tech Team Danao:

**Team Danao** performed an independent peer review and implementation of the framework originally proposed by Microsoft Research. This implementation:
- Successfully reproduces the in-context learning approach for medical segmentation
- Validates the paper's claims on real medical imaging datasets
- Extends the methodology to new domains (brain segmentation)
- Utilizes the [Texas Tech High Performance Computing Center](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/hpcc/) in Lubbock, Texas

The trained spleen segmentation model (13 MB) achieving 75% DICE on AMOS22 data is available for download in the releases folder at https://github.com/mister-weeden/abts25

### Why This Matters:

1. **Reproducibility Crisis**: Many AI papers cannot be reproduced; this implementation proves IRIS works
2. **Open Science**: Provides the community with working code to build upon
3. **Practical Impact**: Enables researchers worldwide to use in-context learning for medical segmentation
4. **Innovation Platform**: Forms the foundation for advancing to brain hemisphere segmentation with unprecedented granularity 

**Frameworks for spleen segmentation**: The medical imaging field relies on **nnU-Net** (self-configuring U-Net achieving >90% Dice scores) and **MONAI** (PyTorch-based framework with pre-trained spleen models achieving 0.961 Dice score on Medical Segmentation Decathlon). These frameworks implement 3D U-Net architectures with automatic preprocessing pipelines, patch-based training (128¬≥-192¬≥ patches), and combined Dice + Cross-entropy loss functions.

## 4. Texas Tech HPCC Infrastructure

### RedRaider cluster provides 2.2 petaflops for deep learning

Texas Tech's HPCC offers specialized GPU partitions optimal for medical imaging: **Matador partition** (20 nodes with 40 NVIDIA GPUs, 384 GB RAM/node) and **Toreador partition** (11 nodes with 33 GPUs, 192 GB RAM/node), all connected via Mellanox HDR 100 Gbps InfiniBand. The system runs Rocky Linux with **6.9 PB Lustre filesystem** for large dataset storage.

**Deep learning environment setup**: The cluster supports MiniForge (replacing Anaconda) for Python environments, Apptainer (formerly Singularity) for containerization, and SLURM for job scheduling. GPU jobs can request up to 384 GB RAM per node with access to CUDA modules and pre-built deep learning containers. Interactive sessions enable development with Jupyter notebook support through SSH tunneling.

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=matador
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:2
#SBATCH --mem=128G
#SBATCH --time=48:00:00
conda activate medical_imaging
python segmentation_training.py --batch_size 4 --num_workers 16
```

## 5. Adapting Abdominal Segmentation to Brain Imaging

### Three-stage cross-domain adaptation process maximizes transfer

Successfully adapting spleen segmentation models to brain aneurysm detection requires addressing fundamental domain shifts in anatomical structure (compact homogeneous spleen vs. complex heterogeneous brain), imaging characteristics (CT Hounsfield units vs. MRI intensity variations), and size distributions.

**Stage 1 - Cross-modal pre-training**: Freeze the encoder backbone from abdominal models while training new decoder heads specific to brain anatomy. This preserves learned low-level features while adapting high-level representations.

**Stage 2 - Domain-specific fine-tuning**: Selectively unfreeze deeper layers (blocks 4-6) with differential learning rates (encoder: 1e-5, decoder: 1e-3). Implement brain-specific preprocessing including skull stripping, N4 bias correction, and white-stripe normalization for MRI data.

**Stage 3 - Task optimization**: Full fine-tuning with regularization (dropout 0.2, weight decay 1e-4) using hybrid loss functions combining segmentation accuracy with domain adaptation and anatomical consistency constraints.

**Critical implementation details**: Replace CT windowing ([-160, 240] HU for abdomen) with brain-appropriate ranges ([0, 80] HU for brain tissue). Implement attention mechanisms for complex brain structures and multi-scale processing with dilated convolutions. Recent research demonstrates **5-10% Dice score improvements** when proper adaptation techniques are applied, with frameworks like SIFA achieving >70% improvement in cross-modal scenarios.

## 6. HPC Medical Imaging Technical Requirements

### GPU memory determines segmentation capabilities

**Hardware requirements scale with volume size**: 3D U-Net processing 128¬≥ volumes requires 12-24GB GPU memory per sample, while nnU-Net needs 8-16GB depending on patch size. For production workloads, **A100 GPUs (40/80GB)** support batch sizes 2-4 for 3D volumes, with H100 (80GB) enabling batch sizes 4-8. System RAM should be **2x total GPU VRAM minimum** (1.3TB for 8x A100 setup).

**Storage and I/O optimization**: NVMe SSDs (10-50TB) for active datasets with Lustre/GPFS parallel filesystems (100TB+) for shared storage. Achieve 5-10GB/s sustained read speeds through caching strategies: MONAI's CacheDataset for small datasets, PersistentDataset for disk caching, or SmartCacheDataset for dynamic memory management.

**Memory optimization techniques**:
- **Gradient checkpointing**: Reduces memory by 50-70% through selective recomputation
- **Mixed precision (FP16/BF16)**: Cuts memory usage by ~40% with minimal accuracy loss
- **Adaptive batch sizing**: Dynamically find maximum batch size without OOM errors

**Distributed training configuration**:
```python
# Multi-node setup with proper memory management
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb:128,garbage_collection_threshold:0.6
model = DistributedDataParallel(model, device_ids=[local_rank])
# Use synchronized batch normalization for multi-GPU consistency
model = nn.SyncBatchNorm.convert_sync_batchnorm(model)
```
